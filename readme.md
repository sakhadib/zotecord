# ZotecoRD - Zotero to Discord Integration Bot

ZotecoRD is a Discord bot that bridges Zotero research management with Discord communication and Google Sheets data organization. It allows researchers to seamlessly extract highlighted annotations from Zotero PDFs and distribute them to categorized Discord channels, while also pushing comprehensive metadata to Google Sheets for collaborative research tracking.

## üî• Features

- **Smart Annotation Extraction**: Automatically extracts color-coded highlights from Zotero PDF annotations
- **Discord Integration**: Distributes annotations to specific Discord channels based on highlight colors
- **Google Sheets Export**: Pushes complete research metadata to Google Sheets for collaborative tracking
- **Color-Coded Organization**: Maps highlight colors to research categories (methods, contributions, results, claims, limitations)
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant processing of Zotero attachment keys via Discord commands

## üéØ Color Mapping System

ZotecoRD uses a sophisticated color-coding system to categorize research highlights:

| Color | Category | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| üü° Yellow | Methods | Research methodology and approaches |
| üü¢ Green | Contributions | Key contributions and novel findings |
| üîµ Blue | Results | Research results and outcomes |
| üü£ Purple | Claims | Claims and assertions made by authors |
| üî¥ Red | Limitations | Study limitations and constraints |

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Zotero Desktop**: Installed with PDF annotations
- **Discord Account**: With bot creation permissions

ZOTERO_DB_PATH = r"C:\Users\{username}\Zotero\zotero.sqlite"

# macOS
# ZOTERO_DB_PATH = "/Users/{username}/Zotero/zotero.sqlite"

# Linux
# ZOTERO_DB_PATH = "/home/{username}/Zotero/zotero.sqlite"
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Starting the Bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Logged in as ZotecoRD#1234 (ID: 123456789)
Bot is ready to receive \pull and \push commands.
```

### Discord Commands

#### `\pull <item_key>`
Extracts annotations from a Zotero PDF and distributes them to Discord channels.

**Example**:
```
\pull RFCM2DHI
```

**What it does**:
1. Queries Zotero database for the attachment
2. Extracts all color-coded annotations
3. Groups annotations by color
4. Sends each color group to its designated Discord channel
5. Includes paper title and URL when available

#### `\push <item_key>`
Exports complete research metadata to Google Sheets.

**Example**:
```
\push RFCM2DHI
```

**What it does**:
1. Extracts comprehensive metadata (title, authors, year, venue, DOI)
2. Organizes all annotations by color category
3. Formats data for spreadsheet entry
4. Appends new row to Google Sheets

### Finding Zotero Item Keys

1. **In Zotero Desktop**:
   - Right-click on PDF attachment
   - Select "Copy Zotero URI"
   - Extract the 8-character key from the URI

2. **From Zotero URI**:
   ```
   zotero://select/library/items/RFCM2DHI
                                 ^^^^^^^^ (this is your item key)
   ```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Zotero DB not found"**:
   - Verify Zotero installation path
   - Update `ZOTERO_DB_PATH` in `zotero_reader.py`
   - Ensure Zotero is closed when running the bot

2. **"No annotations found"**:
   - Verify the item key is correct
   - Ensure PDF has highlighted text (not just notes)
   - Check that highlights use the supported colors

3. **Discord channel errors**:
   - Verify all channel IDs in `config.py`
   - Ensure bot has permission to send messages
   - Check that channels exist and bot can access them

4. **Google Sheets permission errors**:
   - Verify service account has access to the spreadsheet
   - Check that the spreadsheet ID is correct
   - Ensure Google Sheets API is enabled

### Debug Mode

For troubleshooting, you can use the debug scripts:
```bash
python debug.py <item_key>  # Debug specific item
python expose.py           # Explore database structure
```
